\section{Introduction}

There has been much talk of the current housing crisis in the media, and plentiful speculation as to who has been worst hit and how long it might last.  In this chapter we examine these issues by analyzing the sales of half a million homes in the San Francisco Bay Area.  We use a few simple statistical tools, but we place our primary focus on graphical displays of the data.  

% (Given that none of us live there, you might wonder why we chose to explore the Bay Area, but it revolves around the availability of the data.)

To perform our investigation, we mainly use R, a statistical programming and data analysis environment.  We will discuss R and a few other tools we use in more depth later, but we begin by describing how we obtained the data, as well as the cleaning and transformations we performed before we could proceed with the analysis. We conclude by describing the interesting features that we uncovered, and we summarize what the data tell us about the housing crisis in the Bay area.

\section{How did we get the data?}

Finding relevant datasets for a particular problem is challenging and requires a lot of exploration and investigation.  We were particularly lucky to uncover weekly house sales for the Bay Area produced by the San Francisco Chronicle, \url{http://www.sfgate.com/homesales/}.  Initially we had planned on reading the data off the website, but a little detective work revealed that the data are already available in a machine-readable format.  Each human-readable (html web page) weekly summary is built from a text file that looks like this: 

\begin{verbatim}
rowid: 1
county: Alameda County
city: Alameda
newcity: 1
zip: 94501
street: 1220 Broadway
price: 509,000
br: 4
lsqft: 4420
bsqft: 1834
year: 1910
\end{verbatim}

Each week of data is available at a url of the form \url{http://www.sfgate.com/c/a/year/month/day/REHS.tbl}.  This is pretty convenient, and only requires generating a list of all Sundays from the first on record, 2003/04/27 (which we found on the archive page), to the most recent, 2008/11/16 (at the time of analysis).  With this list of dates in hand, we then generated a list of urls in the correct format and downloaded them with the Unix command line tool {\tt wget}. We used wget because it can easily resume where it left off if interrupted.
% this saves a lot of time when you're moving from place to place on a laptop.

With all the data on a local computer, the next step was to convert the data into a standard format.  We use csv (comma separated values) for most datasets: although there is no standards document that exactly describes the structure of csv files, for most statistical datasets it is not complicated and every statistical package (and Excel!) can read them without problems.  This gives us a csv file of the form:

\begin{verbatim}
county,city,zip,street,price,br,lsqft,bsqft,year,date,datesold
Alameda County,Alameda,94501,1220 Broadway,509000,4,4420,1834,1910,2003-04-27,NA
Alameda County,Alameda,94501,429 Fair Haven Road,504000,4,6300,1411,1964,2003-04
-27,NA
Alameda County,Alameda,94501,2804 Fernside Boulevard,526000,2,4000,1272,1941,200
3-04-27,NA
Alameda County,Alameda,94501,1316 Grove Street,637000,3,2700,1168,1910,2003-04-2
7,NA
\end{verbatim}

This is a little less human-readable than the previous form, but is very easy to work with using R.  Another minor advantage is that it is much smaller than the original:  45 vs 90 megabytes.  If you look closely at the sample data you might notice something that needs some explanation: the {\bf NA}s.  NA stands for not applicable, and is the sentinel value that R uses to represent missing values. We must take care to account for the missing values in our analysis.
%Missing values have special semantics which, by default, will propagate missingness throughout a summary:  + NA = NA, 5 < NA = NA and so on. We always need to make a deliberate decision to drop the missing values from an analysis.

It takes only a few minutes to parse the files for all 293 weeks and create {\tt house-sales.csv}, a csv file with 521,726 observations and 11 variables.  It took much more time to tweak the parser to get all the edge cases right: we needed to convert prices to regular numbers (by removing \$ and ,), parse the dates into a consistent format, and fill in missing values for fields that didn't occur in all of the tables.  This is quite common in data analysis: it can take far longer to prepare the data in a consistent, machine-readable form than it takes to perform the actual analysis.
%the time taken to compute the answer is totally overwhelmed by the time necessary to develop the correct approach.

\section{Geocoding} 

When we first looked at these data, we thought it would be really important to geocode all 436,107 unique addresses.  That is, we wanted to associate a latitude and longitude with each address so that it would be easy to explore fine-grained spatial effects. This is an interesting challenge: how can you geocode nearly half a million addresses? 
%In the end, we didn't end up using this extra data as much as we thought we would, but it is still an interesting challenge: how can you geocode nearly half a million addresses?  

We started by looking at the well-known web services provided by Google and Yahoo! These were unsuitable for two reasons: they impose strict daily limits on the number of requests, and there are cumbersome restrictions on the use of the resulting data.  The request limit alone meant that it would take well over a month to geocode all the addresses, and then the licensing would have affected publication of the results! After further investigation we found a very useful open service, the USC WebGIS, provided by the GIS research laboratory at the University of Southern California \citep{uscgis}.  This service is free for non-commercial use and makes no restrictions on the uses to which you can put the data.  There is no daily usage cap, but there is an implicit cap caused by the speed: we could only geocode about 80,000 addresses per day, so it took us around 5 days to do all 400,000.  The disadvantage of this free service is that the quality of the geocoding is not quite as good (they only use publicly available address data), but the creators were very helpful and have published an excellent free introduction to the topic in \citet{goldberg:2008}.  (We suspect that the software included a bug during the period we used it, so that large numbers of addresses were falsely assigned to the Los Angeles area and elsewhere around the state; we remapped these addresses using another free on-line service at gpsvisualizer.com.)

As well as latitude and longitude, the USC results also include an indication of how accurate the geocoding is.  10\%  percent of the addresses were located exactly based on property boundaries (extremely accurate), another 75\% percent were located by interpolating between the numbers at each end of the block (very accurate), 7\% to the centre of the zip code (not very accurate) and the remainder were only located to the centre of the city or not at all.  

%       QUALITY_ADDRESS_RANGE_INTERPOLATION 75.30\%
%             QUALITY_EXACT_PARCEL_CENTROID  9.85\%
% QUALITY_ZIP_CODE_TABULATION_AREA_CENTROID  7.11\%
%       QUALITY_COUNTY_SUBDIVISION_CENTROID  0.12\%
%         QUALITY_UNIFORM_LOT_INTERPOLATION  0.04\%

\section{Data checking}

It is worth spending significant time with the data to ensure accuracy.  If there are errors, they will propagate through to the rest of our analysis.  We discovered quite a few unusual locations!  Errors in geocoding come from a number of sources:  There are typographical errors in the addresses, and new buildings are often not listed in public databases.  The addresses in San Jose were a particular challenge.  Sales are listed for several ``towns'' that are not acknowledged in any mapping sites we could find, so we assume they are informal names for neighbourhoods: North, South, East and West San Jose, Berryessa, Cambrian, and a few others.  Our debugging process included drawing simple maps by county and town to identify the addresses that had been located far afield.

Where possible we tried to correct any errors.  When that was not possible, we used R's missing values to indicate that we do not know the exact latitude and longitude.  This is a better approach than throwing out bad matches, because we need varying levels of accuracy for different  purposes: city level accuracy is fine when we are comparing cities, we will need address level when we are looking within a city, or focusing on purely geographical comparisons.  The use of missing values for latitude and longitude ensures that any location with a suspicious geocoding will be dropped from analyses that uses latitude and longitude, but included in all others.

\section{Analysis}

It is best to start an analysis with a very broad overview.  Since we are interested in the housing crisis, we will look at the weekly number of sales and the average price.  Once we have a feel for the overall patterns, we will divide the data into smaller pieces and see how they compare to each other and to the overall patterns.  We will examine the data using house price (from most expensive to least), and spatially, both between cities and within a single city (San Francisco).

Figure~\ref{fig:daily} shows weekly sale numbers and average prices for the 293 weeks of the data.  There are some very interesting patterns.  The behavior of the average price is striking, with an increasing trend until June 2007 and then a sharp drop to the present day --- the housing crisis.  Sales show a different pattern.  From mid 2006, we see a gradual decrease in sales volume, and then an increasing trend in early 2008.  One possibility is that by this point house prices had dropped enough that buyers were shopping for bargains again.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \caption{Weekly sales (left) and average prices (right).}
  \label{fig:daily}
\end{figure}


\subsection{The influence of inflation}
% explore-prices.r

The data were collected over a relatively short period of time (almost 6 years), but we might wonder if it is necessary to adjust for inflation, to ensure that the prices paid in 2003 are comparable to the prices paid today.  A commonly used reference for calculating inflation is the consumer price index ({\sc cpi}) produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, \url{http://www.bls.gov/CPI}.  The {\sc cpi} calculates the price of a weighted ``basket'' of frequently purchased consumer goods.  This price is calculated monthly, and we will use the West coast series, series CUUR0400SA0, to adjust for inflation as follows.  We want to adjust all values to 2003 dollars, so we divide each {\sc cpi} value by its value in March 2003.  This operation is also known as indexing, and gives the relative worth of a 2003 dollar at each point in time and makes it easy to read the effect of inflation from the graph: a value of 1.1 represents a cumulative inflation of 10\% from the start of the data.  
%Indexing is a very useful technique and we'll use it throughout our analysis.  
Figure~\ref{fig:inflation} shows the {\sc cpi}-based inflation measurement and the effect of adjusting prices for inflation.  Inflation has been steadily climbing over the last five years, and we can see that the inflation-adjusted rise in house prices is slightly less pronounced than the unadjusted trend. However, because housing prices have an important, if indirect, influence on the {\sc cpi}, we chose to work with the actual, unadjusted prices in our analysis.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5 \linewidth]{daily-cpi}%
    \includegraphics[width=0.5 \linewidth]{daily-price-adj}
  \caption{(Left) Inflation, indexed at 1 at start of series.  (Right) Inflation-adjusted house prices in 2003 dollars (black), and unadjusted prices (grey).  Failing to adjust for inflation makes the rise look a bit steeper, but has little effect on the decline.}
  \label{fig:inflation}
\end{figure}

With this basic overview in hand, we now drill down into the details. In the following sections we break the house sales into smaller groups, first by price and then by location.  We will see whether the housing crisis has affected all homeowners equally, or some more than others.

\subsection{The rich get richer and the poor get poorer}
% explore-deciles.r

Has the housing crisis equally affected the rich and the poor?  Has the effect of the crisis been to improve or worsen the relative equality of these two groups?  In this section, we will explore how the crisis has affected the distribution of housing prices.  A big caveat is that we are looking at the Bay Area, so homes will be more expensive than many other places in the country, but we still expect to see some relative inequalities.

As a first step, we calculate price deciles for each month.  The deciles are the nine prices for which 10\%, 20\%, 30\%, 40\%, 50\%, 60\%, 70\%, 80\%, and 90\% of houses cost less.  This is a succinct summary of the {\it distribution} of the prices for each month: instead of just looking at the average price, as we did earlier, we have nine numbers that summarise the complete distribution of the prices. 

Figure~\ref{fig:decile-raw} shows how these deciles have changed over time.  The top line is the ninth decile, the price that 90\% of houses are less than, and the bottom line is the first decile, the price that only 10\% of houses are cheaper than.  The line in the middle is the median, the price which divides the houses into halves, half cheaper and half more expensive.  The lines are coloured from dark to light from expensive to cheap.  Each line follows a similar pattern, and we can see the effect of the housing bubble in mid 2007, particularly in the most expensive houses.  

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{decile-raw}
  \caption{Monthly average house price within each decile.  Lower lower deciles have lighter colours.} 
  \label{fig:decile-raw}
\end{figure}

This plot lets us compare the absolute values of each decile, but maybe it is more appropriate to look at the relative prices: how have the prices changed proportionately?  One way to look at the relative price is to compare each decile to its initial value.  To do this we index each decile, dividing each series by its initial price, just as we did for the {\sc cpi}. Figure~\ref{fig:decile-ind} shows these indices.  Each decile starts at one, and we can see the relative change in prices over time.  The interesting aspect of this plot is that the cheaper houses (the lighter coloured lines) seem to peak higher and earlier (mid 2005), and then drop more rapidly thereafter.  The cheapest houses, in the lowest decile, lost 43\% of their 2003 value compared to only 9\% for the most expensive houses. Comparing Figures~\ref{fig:decile-ind} and \ref{fig:decile-ind}, we see that although the biggest decline in actual prices occurred at the expensive end, it was the cheapest houses that proportionately lost the most value. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{decile-ind}
  \caption{Indexed house price within each decile.  The average price of cheaper houses peaked higher and earlier, and fell more steeply.}
  \label{fig:decile-ind}
\end{figure}

Another way to look at this inequality is Figure~\ref{fig:decile-rel}.  Here we have divided all the prices by the price of an average (median) home.  The values now represent a proportion of the median house price: a value of 1.2 represents a price 20\% higher than the median, and 0.8 is 20\% lower. Since the beginning of 2007 (before the slump began) the relative inequality has been growing.  This is interesting: does it suggest that a widening of the price gap between expensive and cheap homes is a precursor to a subsequent crisis? Has this preceded other crises? These questions could be investigated further.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{decile-rel}
  \caption{House prices, relative to the price of the median priced home.  The disparity in home prices is increasing.}
  \label{fig:decile-rel}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Geographic differences}
% explore-city.r

We have seen the how the housing crisis has affected expensive and cheap houses differently, but how has it affected different cities?  In this section we explore the effects on different cities in the Bay area.  Because we are looking at average prices, we must take care not to include cities with insufficient data.  We decided to focus on all cities with an average of at least 10 sales per week. This gave us 58 cities (out of 245, 24\%) with 428,415 sales (out of 521,726, 82\%).  

We then calculated the average weekly house price. Figure~\ref{fig:spaghetti} shows these prices, with each city drawn with a different line.  Statisticians have an evocative name for this type of display: the spaghetti plot.  It's very hard to see anything in the big jumble of lines.  One method of improvement is to smooth each line, to focus on the long-term trend and remove the short-term variation that we are less interested in. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{cities-price}
  \caption{Average sale price for each week for each city.  This type of plot is often called a spaghetti plot.}
  \label{fig:spaghetti}
\end{figure}

There are many different ways to create smooth curves, and for our purposes of them most of them will work.  We used generalised additive models ({\sc gam}), a generalisation of linear models \citep{wood:2006}, that fit smooth curves by optimising the trade off between being close to the data and being very smooth. The effect is to remove noisy short-term effects and to focus on the long-term trend.  This is what we need: we are not interested in daily or weekly changes, only the long-term changes related to the housing crisis.

The left part of Figure~\ref{fig:smoothed} shows the result of this smoothing. This is a big improvement and we can now actually see some patterns! Note the big difference in scales between this plot and the first: smoothing the data has removed the large spikes which represent the sales of a few very expensive houses. We will also index each city in the same way we indexed each decile: dividing by the starting price puts each city onto a common scale and allows us to focus on the changes.  This is shown on the right of Figure 7.  

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5 \linewidth]{cities-smooth}%
  \includegraphics[width=0.5 \linewidth]{cities-indexed}
  \caption{Smoothed city-level weekly average sale prices.  Compared to the non-smoothed version it's easier to see the long-term trends, but it's still not particularly easy.}
  \label{fig:smoothed}
\end{figure}

There is a still a lot of variation, but we can start to see a pattern of increasing values until mid 2007, and then decreasing values afterwards.  To get any further, we need to look at the cities individually, as in Figure~\ref{fig:individual}.  This plot takes up a lot of space but is worthwhile for the extra information it affords.  We can pick out some interesting patterns: Berkeley and San Francisco show less of a peak and less of a drop, and Mountain View is unique in that it has seen no drop at all.  Other cities such as Oakley, Vallejo, and San Pablo, show both big peaks and big drops.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{cities-individual}
  \caption{Individual plots for each city.}
  \label{fig:individual}
\end{figure}

% Figure~\ref{fig:clustering} shows one way of clustering the cities into three groups.  Note how the groups are basically formed along the diagonal: it's the difference between the peak and the plummet that seems to be telling us the most.  Figure~\ref{fig:clustered} shows the result of the clustering, with each of the three groups displayed in its own panel.  The groups are somewhat arbitrary (we could shift the boundaries a little in either direction and have little effect)
% 
% \begin{figure}[htbp]
%   \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=0.7 \linewidth]{cities-clustering}
%   \caption{A scatterplot of cities with height at peak on x axis, and most recent value (plummet) on y axis.  The cities have been clustered into three groups.  The closer a city is to the line in the top left corner, the less the effect of the housing crisis on average prices.}
%   \label{fig:clustering}
% \end{figure}
% 
% \begin{figure}[htbp]
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{cities-indexed-clustered}
%   \caption{The index sale price time series for the three clustered identified in Figure~\ref{fig:clustering}.  Cluster one includes cities with low peak and no plummet, cluster two cities with high peak and big plummet, and cluster three is somewhere in between.  The thick lines represent smoothed patterns within each cluster.}
%   \label{fig:clustered}
% \end{figure}

After further investigation we concluded that there was one main feature that seemed to distinguish the different cities: the difference between prices at the peak of the boom and the depth of their most recent plummet.  We create a new variable called drop, which is the difference between the price in February 2006 (at the height of the boom) and the price in November 2008 (the current doldrums at the time of writing). Figure~\ref{fig:groups} groups the cities by this new variable.  The divisions are arbitrary, but one can see how the cities in each group follow a similar pattern: the bigger the boom, the bigger the collapse.  This suggests that this single number does a good job of summarising the different effects of the housing crisis.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{cities-indexed-grouped}
  \caption{A separate plot for each 0.2 interval drop.  The patterns within each group are similar, suggesting that this single number provides a useful way to divide the cities into groups.}
  \label{fig:groups}
\end{figure}

We have determined that some cities showed a different pattern to others, but why? The geographic pattern, as in Figure~\ref{fig:geo} does not reveal anything particularly striking except that the worst hit towns tend to be to the north and the east. This does not offer much in the way of explanatory power, so we looked for additional data that might help us gain a deeper understanding. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{cities-geo-changes}
  \caption{The geographic distribution of price drops.}
  \label{fig:geo}
\end{figure}

\section{Census information}

The US Census Bureau provides demographic data from recent surveys at both the county and city levels. The quickfacts website, e.g.\ \url{http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06/0649670.html}, displays a number of interesting demographic variables for each city. Unfortunately these data, specifically at the city level, are not available in an easily downloadable format. We therefore used scripting methods, similar to those we used for the sales data, to collect the demographic information and convert it into csv.  In addition, the definition of a city differed slightly between the census data and the sales data, so we could only match 46 out of the full 58 cities.  The cities that we could not match were either too small or were included in a larger city in the census data.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.33\linewidth]{cities-income}%
  \includegraphics[width=0.33\linewidth]{cities-grads}%
  \includegraphics[width=0.33\linewidth]{cities-commute}
  
  \caption{From left to right, the relationship between the drop in house prices and average income, percent of college graduates and average commute time.}
  \label{fig:census}
\end{figure}

A glance at the demographic variables revealed that the most affected cities have a high percentage of babies and children, bigger households, fewer bachelors degrees, and longer commutes.  Most significantly these cities also have lower average incomes, which is likely the factor that drives all of the other relationships. Figure~\ref{fig:census} shows three scatterplots that illustrate the relationship between the drop and income, percentage of college graduates and commute time.  The relationship with commute time is weak, but striking in that all of the cities with particularly long commute times (>25 minutes) have particularly large drops. It appears that the housing crisis has been relatively more damaging in poorer areas.

The county-level census data contains more variables than the data for cities, so we analyzed the county data for further explanation of the housing crisis. The plot on the left in Figure~\ref{fig:newconstruct} shows, for each county in which we had sales data, the percentage change in the number of housing units (from 2000 to 2006) plotted against the median sale price in 2008. There is a strong negative relationship between recent home values and the amount of new construction. In other words, most of the building boom in recent years occurred in poorer neighborhoods, and as we noted above, these are also the areas where the subsequent slump has been the most severe. San Joaquin county, in particular, which has consistently low prices across towns, experienced by far the most new construction in recent years.  We should note that we do not have many sales in a few of these counties ( FILL), but the overall nature of this relationship is still very clear. The effect is further illustrated in the right-hand plot in Figure~\ref{fig:newconstruct}, which shows the median price for all the sales in each year, as well as the median sale price for the subset of homes built in that year (and then sold in that year or later). We see that despite the large overall boom from 2003 to 2006, the new construction during this period was aimed increasingly at the lower end of the market.  

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
%    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{county_newconstruct}%
%    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{yearbuilt_recent}
  \caption{Influence of new construction on recent prices. [to be regenerated]}
  \label{fig:newconstruct}
\end{figure}

According to an article in the New York Times \citep{mckinley:2007}, the city of Stockton, one of the larger cities in San Joaquin county, already had the highest rate of foreclosures in the USA by the summer of 2007. Unfortunately we do not have any sales for Stockton prior to 2008, but it appears it was a leading indicator of the slump in the region that would continue into 2008. The population of Stockton grew rapidly in the last decade as commuters moved further out to escape the overheated housing market in the immediate Bay area. This helps to explain the new construction noted earlier, and also ties into our observation regarding commute times. The article also lists Modesto and Merced, two other towns in the Central Valley, in the Top 10 nationwide for foreclosures at that time.

\section{Exploring San Francisco}

Having explored the difference between cities, we turned to look at a single city in more detail.  We chose San Francisco because it is the city with which we were most familiar, and it has some iconic features that should be easy for others to identify as well.  We started our exploration by extracting all addresses within San Francisco that were geocoded to block interpolation or better, giving us a total of 25,377 addresses.  We created a simple scatterplot of the latitudes and longitudes, Figure~\ref{fig:sf-geo}.  For the residential parts of the city, this gives an amazingly detailed picture.  We can see the orientation of the streets, the waterfront boundaries and parks.  Our view of some areas, like downtown, is more patchy because there are fewer residential homes there.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=2in]{sf-geo}%
  \includegraphics[height=2in]{sf-map}
  \caption{(Left) A small point is drawn for every house sale in the data.  It gives us a pretty feel for the layout of San Franciscio. (Right) For comparison, a street map of San Francisco from \url{http://openstreetmap.com}}
  \label{fig:sf-geo}
\end{figure}

One problem with this plot is we cannot see the number of sales at each specific location. Figure~\ref{fig:sf-n} shows two attempts to recapture the information. On the left, we have a bubbleplot with the size of the location proportional to the number of sales. We now get quite a different view of the downtown: there are many sales there. Looking closer at the data reveals that these are apartment buildings with hundreds of apartments. On the right, we have divided San Francisco into squares of 0.005 latitude and longitude and counted the number of houses in each bin. This gives us a higher level view showing where the majority of houses are located.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{sf-geo-n}%
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{sf-bin-n}
  \caption{The geographic distribution of numbers of house sales.  (Left) this plot is similar to the previous plot, but the size of the dot is now proportional to the number of sales at each unique location.  This changes the picture significantly, as the large apartment complexes in the city now pop out.  (Right) A display of housing sales at a higher level of aggregation: latitude and longitude are divided into a small number of bins and the number of sales in each bin is counted and displayed as the colour of the bin.}
  \label{fig:sf-n}

Using that same binning, we calculated the mean and coefficient of variation of the house prices.  The coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean.  We use it here because a variation of \$100,000 is relatively much more important when houses are cheap compared to when they are expensive.  Figure~\ref{fig:sf-price} shows the geographic distribution of these two summary statistics.   We can see the most expensive houses border the Presidio and coast to the North of the city.  There also seems to be a peak in the Southwest - this is the affluent St. Francis Wood area, near San Francisco State University.  There is an interesting geographic trend in the coefficient of variation: it appears to increase towards the Northwest.  
%We don't know enough about San Francisco to guess as to why this occurs.

% We can also use this data for an unexpected purpose.  Because the data is so dense and includes the year that the house was built, we can explore historical patterns of housing development.  This idea was inspired by truliaHindsight, \url{http://hindsight.trulia.com/}, but because we have the data in an unencumbered form we are much freer to experiment with the visualisation of this data.  They have much more data, 150,000 vs 27,000, but we can display more (they display at most 2000 points at once), and we can do more sophisticated analyses.

\section{Conclusions}

 % Both code and data are licensed with the permissive MIT license.  We'll illustrate snippets of code and fragments of the data inline, but each section of this chapter will also point you to a matching file online.  The files don't cover the exactly content as each section: you can see some of the dead ends we tried, and some of the plots that weren't quite good enough to make it into the plot.

WE SHOULD START THE CONCLUSION WITH A SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS ABOUT THE HOUSING CRISIS. CAN BE JUST A SENTENCE OR TWO.

We have used relatively simple statistical tools such as indexing, quantiles, smoothing and binning to explore a large and complex data set.  We began with broad summaries and then dug deeper to explore the details, but we have only just scratched the surface.  If the data has caught your interest and you'd like to follow our work in more detail and try out some your own ideas, we have made the all data and code available in a repository at \url{https://github.com/hadley/sfhousing}.  All the tools we used are open source: they are available for download and our work can be replicated. This principle of reproducibility \citep{gentleman:2007} is very important for science: we provide sufficient detail that you can follow our work every step of the way, and you can run code to reproduce exactly what we did.  If we made a mistake, you can easily discover it, fix it and observe the effects on our conclusions.  

The creation of a reproducible data analysis can be a lot of extra work, but once the principles are ingrained in the workflow, it doesn't take that much time.  Importantly, it is not only useful for others, but also to the original analyst, who in time will likely forget the finer details of the work. A well-commented reproducible analysis will save a lot of time when revisited later.
%If you haven't made your analysis reproducible and you come back to it 6 months or a year later (quite common if you are submitting the results to an academic journal), you may look at the code and wonder what on earth you were thinking. If you have made the analysis reproducible and included plenty of comments about your thinking, then you save a lot of time trying to reproduce your previous work and state of mind. It also very useful if your data changes.    In our case, we updated just before writing up the paper so that we had the latest data off the website.  Data changes a lot more than you might think.  Even when your data is about something that has already happened, often the data will change  as errors are discovered and fixed.  Every statistician has a story about a nightmare client whose data would not stay the same from week-to-week.

Another tool that we find useful is source code control.  In an analogous way to software development, this makes it easy to discard parts of the analysis that led nowhere or have been superseded.  The code on the repository website indicates that (by and large) the analysis follows a fairly logical flow.  This is not how it starts off!  Data analysis is a fairly creative process, with many blind alleys, mistakes and alternative approaches.  Inclusion of all of these makes it hard to follow exactly what we did, but removing them completely makes it hard to see all the things that we tried.  
%Using a code versioning system leaves us with a happy medium where the false paths are not immediately visible, but can be looked up (although current tools are somewhat lacking for this purpose).

We enjoy working with data, exploring and learning from it.  We hope we have shared with you our enthusiasm for data analysis, and have shown you some of the tools and techniques that we find most useful.  

% Tools: shell (wget, awk,); perl; R (ggplot2, plyr, reshape).

% Note about graphics: can churn out rough versions for exploration very quickly - takes more time to polish them for publication.  Clarify story, remove extraneous elements and ensure that it supports the text.

% A little tricky because working on this data analysis also lead us to develop some new tools, and it takes some time for these to trickle into released versions.  If you have problems running the code we released, please let us know!  Data analysis like software development.  Local caches to speed things up and to provide some backup if the original sources go down.

% Tension with interactive tools: they are great for discovery, but bad for reproducibility.  Once you have discovered something in your interactive tool, you need to be able to reproduce it independently so that others can see it too.  Area of active research (cite Heer's work).
